# Pairbot

### A simple hubot script to support pair programming.

The initial use case is pretty specific:

As a developer pairing with another developer (my pair), both on an IRC channel,
I'd like to get noticiations forwarded to my pair,
so that I can see them.

But there might be other use cases in the future....

See [`src/pairbot.coffee`](src/pairbot.coffee) for full documentation.
